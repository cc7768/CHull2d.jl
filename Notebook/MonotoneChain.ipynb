    "This algorithm was first introduced by A.M. Andrew in 1979 in the paper \"*Another Efficient Algorithm for Convex Hulls in Two Dimensions*.\" This algorithm also has $O(n \\log n)$ complexity which again is mostly due to sorting. The algorithm will compute the convex hull by computing two pieces: an \"upper\" and \"lower\" hull. The upper hull is the piece of the hull you would see looking down from above and the lower hull is the piece of the hull you would see looking up from below. One benefit this algorithm has over the Graham scan is that it will only require us to sort according to x-value instead of by angle -- This is a computationally simpler problem."
