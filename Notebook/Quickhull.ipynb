    "This algorithm was initially introduced by ??. The complexity of the algorithm is similar to that of quicksort in the sense that on average the complexity is $O(n \\log n)$ with a worst case of $O(n^2)$, but like quicksort it tends to do quite well. A nice feature of the quickhull algorithm is, that unlike the Graham scan or monotone chain algorithms, it extends naturally to higher dimensions.\n"
